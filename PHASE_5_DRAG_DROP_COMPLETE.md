## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **Drag & Drop Stack**
```typescript
// Global drag context
<DragDropProvider>
  // Draggable meal steps
  <DraggableMealStep step={step} mealName={meal.name} />
  
  // Drop zone in todo feed
  <TodoDropZone />
</DragDropProvider>
```

### **Smart Data Transfer**
```typescript
// Drag data structure
{
  type: 'meal-step',
  step: MealStep,
  mealName: string,
  stepNumber: number
}

// Drop zone data
{
  type: 'todo-drop-zone',
  date: '2024-01-15',
  dateLabel: 'today'
}
```

### **Cross-Domain Integration**
```typescript
// Convert meal step to todo
const todoDescription = `${stepData.mealName}: ${stepData.step.instruction}`
await apiClient.createTodo({
  description: todoDescription,
  scheduledFor: dropZoneData.date
})

// Auto-refresh both systems
await Promise.all([
  fetchTodos(),
  fetchWeeklyMeals()
])
```
